# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNNs in PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset using **PyTorch**.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

- **Convolutional layers** with ReLU activation  
- **Max pooling layers** for downsampling  
- **Fully connected layers** for classification  
- **Dropout layers** to reduce overfitting  

## Current Accuracy: 73%
